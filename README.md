#Student Recorder

## Description
As a C++ course project, my teammates and I had to implement an application allowing students to record their previous semester results, but also get help to pick courses for future semesters and to consult all courses
avaible at the university.

## Requirements
Qt and a C++ compiler (i.e. MinGW) are required to run the project.
